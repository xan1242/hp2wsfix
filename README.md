# HP2WSFix
A rudimentary widescreen fix for Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 on PC

# Status
It currently only fixes the resolution in the menu and recalculates the camera's FOV.

FrontEnd and HUD will still be stretched and needs further investigation in the code.


You can also reroute the save file to another directory of your liking.

# Usage
Extract the contents of the .zip file to the game's root directory.

**TEMPORARY** - create a "save" directory in the game's root directory (this will not be necessary at a later point!)

# Downloads
You should be able to download the files necessary in the Releases tab.

# Credits
- ThirteenAG - for the injector, inireader and the Ultimate ASI Loader.
- EA Canada - the game code itself
